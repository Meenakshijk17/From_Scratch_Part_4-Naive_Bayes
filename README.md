# From Scratch - Part-4: Naive Bayes

### Aim
This project aims to develop and implement naive bayes algorithm from scratch, without using ML libraries like Scikit-Learn.


### Motivation - More than just a *model.fit()*
Diving into manual implementation of Naive Bayes is essential for mastering this classic machine learning technique. This hands-on approach reveals key concepts such as conditional probability and feature independence assumption. Through customization and experimentation, practitioners gain practical insights into hyperparameter tuning and handling categorical variables. Crafting the algorithm from scratch deepens understanding and fosters critical thinking, empowering practitioners to tackle diverse classification tasks. This exercise advances proficiency in Naive Bayes, crucial for data science practitioners.
